# what is a Data Type?
# data type specifies the type of value a varible holds. In python, we can print the type of any operator using type functions:
a = 1
print(type(a))

# complex number
n = complex(2,8)
print(n)

#sequenced data : list and tuple
#list : A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets list is mutable

list1 = [9,8,[8,7]]
print(list1)

#tuple : tuple is exact like list but it is immutable

tuple1 = (("parrot","sparrow"),("tiger","lion"))
print(tuple1)

# Mapped data
# dict : A dicitionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key value pair . The key vaalues pairs are enclosed within curly bracketstt
dict1 = {"name":"mansi","age":20,"canvote":True}
print(dict1)
